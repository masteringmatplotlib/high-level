# architecture

## Instructions

The following will set up a local matplotlib environment for you, and start an
IPython Notebook server:

```bash
  $ make setup
  $ make run
```

At which point a browser window will open, with a view of this notebook.

Note that this notebook assumes you have the Graphviz include files installed
under ``/usr/local``. If this is not the case, you will want to manually
install pygraphviz into this virtual env.
